## Description

README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional ``README.md`` file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Walkthrough

Here's a link to a [walkthrough video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-JnNamKpLE&ab_channel=RanGamboa) to show you the generator in action.
